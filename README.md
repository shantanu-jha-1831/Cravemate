Technologies Used
React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Vite: A fast build tool for modern web projects.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

Lucide React: A collection of open-source icons.

Firebase (SDKs via CDN):

Firebase Authentication: For user authentication (anonymous sign-in implemented).

Cloud Firestore: A NoSQL cloud database for data persistence (setup for future integration).

Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

Clone the repository (if applicable):

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd Cravemate

(If you received this project as a direct file set, skip this step and navigate to the Cravemate directory.)

Install dependencies:

npm install

Run the development server:

npm run dev

This will start the Vite development server, usually at http://localhost:5173. Open this URL in your browser to see the app.

Usage
Home Page: Displays a hero section, recommended food items, and popular dishes.

Food Card: Click on any food card to view its details.

Add to Cart: Use the "Add" button on food cards or the "Add to Cart" button on the detail page to add items to your cart.

Cart Page: Click the shopping cart icon in the header to view and manage your cart. You can adjust quantities or remove items.

Checkout: Proceed from the cart page to the checkout to simulate placing an order.

Custom Modal: Any alert or confirm actions are handled by a custom modal component for a consistent UI.

Firebase Integration
This project is pre-configured to work with Firebase in the Canvas environment.

Initialization: Firebase is initialized in src/main.jsx using global variables (__app_id, __firebase_config, __initial_auth_token) provided by the Canvas.

Authentication: Anonymous authentication is set up to provide a userId for data storage.

Firestore: The db instance from Firestore is passed via AppContext and src/services/cartService.js is set up with placeholder functions to interact with Firestore collections for cart data. To enable full persistence, you would implement setDoc, updateDoc, onSnapshot, etc., within cartService.js and integrate them with the AppContext's cart state.

Future Enhancements
Full Firebase Persistence: Implement saving/loading cart data, order history, and user preferences to/from Firestore.

User Authentication: Add email/password or social login options using Firebase Auth.

Advanced Recommendation System:

Track user behavior (views, purchases).

Implement collaborative filtering or content-based recommendations.

Integrate with a backend service or a more sophisticated AI model.

Search and Filters: Allow users to search for food items and filter by category, price, rating, etc.

User Profiles: Create dedicated pages for user profiles, order history, and saved addresses.

Restaurant Listings: Expand to include multiple restaurants and their menus.

Real-time Order Tracking: Implement real-time updates for order status.

Payment Gateway Integration: Connect to a real payment gateway for processing payments.

Admin Panel: A separate interface for managing food items, orders, and users.
